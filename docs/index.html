<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated: April 14, 2025</strong></p>

<p>Welcome to <span class="app-name">"Visual Timer - Timer Plus"</span> (the "App"). Your privacy is important to us, and this Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our App.</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

<p>When you use our App, we and our third-party service providers may collect certain information to provide and improve the App's functionality, display advertisements, analyze usage patterns, and ensure stability. This information generally falls into the following categories:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Details about your device, such as model, operating system version, and other technical identifiers.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Information about how you interact with the App, such as screens viewed, features used, session duration, and interactions with advertisements.</li>
    <li><strong>Crash Data:</strong> Information related to app crashes or errors, including device state at the time of the crash and software version.</li>
    <li><strong>Advertising Identifiers:</strong> Identifiers like the Google Advertising ID (GAID) used for advertising and analytics purposes.</li>
    <li><strong>Approximate Location:</strong> Non-precise location data may be inferred or collected if relevant permissions are granted or based on IP address, primarily for ad relevance and analytics.</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not directly collect personally identifiable information like your name, email address, or phone number unless you voluntarily provide it through contact channels (like emailing support). The primary data collection happens through the third-party services integrated into the App, as detailed below.</p>

<h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>

<p>Our App utilizes third-party services that have their own privacy policies governing how they collect and use your data. These services include:</p>

<h3>Google AdMob</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To display advertisements within the App.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Collected:</strong> AdMob may collect device information, Advertising ID (GAID), app usage data (ad impressions, clicks), and approximate location data (if enabled) for ad personalization, analytics, and fraud prevention.</li>
    <li><strong>Privacy Policy:</strong> Data is handled according to Google's Privacy Policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></li>
    <li><strong>Opt-Out:</strong> You can opt out of personalized ads via your device settings:
        <ul>
            <li>Android: Go to Settings → Google → Ads → Enable "Opt out of Ads Personalization."</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Firebase Analytics (Google Analytics for Firebase)</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To understand how users interact with the App, allowing us to improve user experience and App features.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Collected:</strong> Firebase Analytics automatically collects certain usage and device information, including device model, OS version, session duration, screens viewed, events triggered within the app, Advertising ID, App Instance ID, and potentially demographic or interest data if available through linked advertising features.</li>
    <li><strong>Privacy Policy:</strong> Data collected by Firebase Analytics is managed by Google and covered under Google's Privacy Policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>. You can find more information on Google's use of data from Firebase services here: <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Firebase Crashlytics</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To identify, track, and analyze application crashes and errors, helping us improve the stability and performance of the App.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Collected:</strong> Crashlytics collects crash report data, which includes device state information at the time of a crash, unique device identifiers (like Installation UUID), device model, OS version, and app version. This helps pinpoint the cause of crashes.</li>
    <li><strong>Privacy Policy:</strong> Crashlytics data is handled by Google according to Google's Privacy Policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>. More details specific to Crashlytics data processing can often be found in Firebase documentation or agreements.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Data Security</h2>

<p>We implement reasonable measures to protect any information we might handle directly (like support emails). However, the bulk of the data (usage, crash, advertising data) is collected and secured by our third-party providers (Google) according to their robust security practices and policies. Please refer to Google's Privacy Policy for details on their data security measures.</p>

<h2>4. Children's Privacy</h2>

<p>Our App is not intended for children under the age of 13 (or equivalent minimum age depending on jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. Our third-party services (AdMob, Firebase Analytics, Crashlytics) collect technical, usage, and crash data as described above. Google's policies govern how this data is handled, including measures related to age-appropriate advertising and data collection from users identified as children.</p>

<h2>5. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Advertising:</strong> You can control personalized advertising preferences through your mobile device settings as described in Section 2 (Google AdMob).</li>
    <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> While direct opt-out from Firebase Analytics within the app might not be offered, limiting ad personalization on your device can also limit the use of the Advertising ID for analytics profiling.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Access/Deletion:</strong> Data collected by Google services (AdMob, Firebase Analytics, Crashlytics) is subject to Google's data handling practices. Users may have rights to access or delete data associated with their Google account or device identifiers through tools provided by Google (e.g., Google Dashboard, Google Account settings). Requests regarding data held by Google should typically be directed to Google, following the procedures outlined in their privacy policy.</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or the services we use. Any changes will be posted within the App or on our website, with an updated "Last Updated" date at the top. Your continued use of the App after changes signifies your acceptance of the revised policy.</p>

<h2>7. Contact Us</h2>

<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us at:<br>
    Email: <a href="mailto:anza.technologies1@gmail.com">anza.technologies1@gmail.com</a></p>

<p>By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
